# Swap-USDC-to-ETHER-WBTC
This project demonstrates how to build and test a smart contract that allows users to easily swap tokens and native ETH on the Arbitrum One network.  At its core, it is a simple wrapper around the Uniswap V2 router, exposing functions that let anyone:  Swap one ERC20 token for another  and Swap an ERC20 token for native ETH. Tested in Foundry
